Simple, branded, mobile‑first storefront for selling one‑time and subscription products with Dodo Payments. Built with Next.js App Router, TypeScript, shadcn/ui, Radix UI, and Tailwind CSS.

### Overview

The Storefront lets you publish products from your Dodo Payments dashboard without building a full website. Customers can browse products and purchase via Dodo’s secure checkout.

For full product docs, see the Storefront guide: [docs.dodopayments.com/features/storefront](https://docs.dodopayments.com/features/storefront).

### Key Features

- **Branded storefront**: Store name, logo, and cover image
- **Product segregation**: One‑time vs subscription sections
- **Simple checkout**: "Buy Now" redirects to Dodo checkout
- **Publish/unpublish**: Control what’s visible from the dashboard
- **No extra CMS**: Manage products where you already set pricing and details
- **Mobile‑friendly**: Responsive layout for all devices
- **Test Mode**: Separate test and live storefronts

### Tech Stack

- **Runtime**: Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **UI**: shadcn/ui, Radix UI, Tailwind CSS
- **State/Utils**: Redux Toolkit, zod, date‑fns

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Create a storefront**  
   Set up a new storefront in your [Dodo Payments dashboard](https://app.dodopayments.com).

4. **Access your storefront**  
   Open [http://localhost:3000/[slug]](http://localhost:3000/[slug]), replacing `[slug]` with your storefront's slug from the dashboard.

## Translations (next-intl)

This app uses `next-intl` with locale JSON files under `messages/`.

### Setup

- **Default locale**: `en`
- **Supported locales**: configured in `src/i18n/config.ts`
- **Messages**: one file per locale, e.g. `messages/en.json`

### Run

- Development:

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Production build:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### Switch locales

- The current locale is read from the `NEXT_LOCALE` cookie (defaults to `en`).
- Changing language from the storefront locale switcher updates this cookie.

Examples:
- Set to German: `NEXT_LOCALE=de`
- Set to Spanish: `NEXT_LOCALE=es`

Reload the page after changing the cookie.

### Adding Translations

- **Server Components**: Use `getTranslations()` from `next-intl/server`
- **Client Components**: Use `useTranslations()` from `next-intl`

## Project Structure

- `src/app`: Next.js App Router pages, layouts, and route handlers
- `src/components`: UI components (custom, product, and shadcn‑based primitives)
- `src/lib` and `src/constants`: Utilities and constants
- `public`: Static assets (logos, banners, images)

Example brand assets used in docs/social embeds live under `public/images/brand-assets/`.

## Storefront Basics

This repository focuses on the customer‑facing storefront. Product data, pricing, and publish/unpublish are managed in your Dodo Payments dashboard. Customers select quantity and proceed to secure checkout on Dodo. After payment, Dodo shows confirmation and can optionally redirect back to your storefront.

Refer to the Storefront documentation for end‑to‑end setup and merchant workflows: [docs.dodopayments.com/features/storefront](https://docs.dodopayments.com/features/storefront).
