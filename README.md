Simple, branded, mobile‑first storefront for selling one‑time and subscription products with Dodo Payments. Built with Next.js App Router, TypeScript, shadcn/ui, Radix UI, and Tailwind CSS.

### Overview

The Storefront lets you publish products from your Dodo Payments dashboard without building a full website. Customers can browse products and purchase via Dodo’s secure checkout.

For full product docs, see the Storefront guide: [docs.dodopayments.com/features/storefront](https://docs.dodopayments.com/features/storefront).

### Key Features

- **Branded storefront**: Store name, logo, and cover image
- **Product segregation**: One‑time vs subscription sections
- **Simple checkout**: "Buy Now" redirects to Dodo checkout
- **Publish/unpublish**: Control what’s visible from the dashboard
- **No extra CMS**: Manage products where you already set pricing and details
- **Mobile‑friendly**: Responsive layout for all devices
- **Test Mode**: Separate test and live storefronts

### Tech Stack

- **Runtime**: Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **UI**: shadcn/ui, Radix UI, Tailwind CSS
- **State/Utils**: Redux Toolkit, zod, date‑fns

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Create a storefront**  
   Set up a new storefront in your [Dodo Payments dashboard](https://app.dodopayments.com).

4. **Access your storefront**  
   Open [http://localhost:3000/[slug]](http://localhost:3000/[slug]), replacing `[slug]` with your storefront's slug from the dashboard.


### Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Start dev server
- `npm run build`: Create production build
- `npm run start`: Start production server
- `npm run lint`: Lint codebase

## Translations (Lingo.dev Compiler)

This app uses Lingo.dev Compiler to localize UI text at build time without changing components. The compiler extracts strings from `src/app/`, generates dictionaries under `lingo/`, and injects translations during build.

### Setup

- **API key**: Obtain from Lingo.dev Engine and set the environment variable before running builds/dev:

```bash
export LINGO_API_KEY="<your_api_key>"
```

- **Locales**: Source locale is `en`. Target locales configured in `next.config.ts` are `de` and `es` for this PR.

### Run

- Development:

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Production build:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

The compiler will create/update dictionaries in the `lingo/` directory and use them to render localized content.

### Switch locales

- The current locale is read from the `lingo-locale` cookie (defaults to `en`). You can switch locales by setting this cookie in the browser DevTools Application tab, or via a simple link/action that sets the cookie on the server using `setUserLocale(locale)` from `src/lib/i18n-helper.ts`.

Examples:
- Set to German: `lingo-locale=de`
- Set to Spanish: `lingo-locale=es`

Reload the page after changing the cookie.

### Notes

- Dictionaries are versioned by content fingerprint; only changed strings retranslate.
- If you see missing translations during development, rebuild or refresh once the dictionary updates.

## Project Structure

Key folders:

- `src/app`: Next.js App Router pages, layouts, and route handlers
- `src/components`: UI components (custom, product, and shadcn‑based primitives)
- `src/lib` and `src/constants`: Utilities and constants
- `public`: Static assets (logos, banners, images)

Example brand assets used in docs/social embeds live under `public/images/brand-assets/`.

## Storefront Basics

This repository focuses on the customer‑facing storefront. Product data, pricing, and publish/unpublish are managed in your Dodo Payments dashboard. Customers select quantity and proceed to secure checkout on Dodo. After payment, Dodo shows confirmation and can optionally redirect back to your storefront.

Refer to the Storefront documentation for end‑to‑end setup and merchant workflows: [docs.dodopayments.com/features/storefront](https://docs.dodopayments.com/features/storefront).
